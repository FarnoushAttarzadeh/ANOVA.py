I studied the correlation between horizontal and vertical wind in the Troposphere using Doppler Radars data. I conducted a linear regression algorithm and investigated multiple features to understand if this correlation happens due to gravity waves or turbulence or other factors and understanding the importance of each feature, using Python. I tested my experiments with different statistical methods such as ANOVA analysis or calculating moving standard deviations. I was also responsible for the data visualization and presenting them to an audience with diverse backgrounds.
