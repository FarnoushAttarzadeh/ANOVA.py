I studied the correlation between horizontal and vertical wind in the Troposphere using Doppler radar data. I conducted a linear regression algorithm and investigated multiple features to understand if this correlation happens due to gravity waves, turbulence or other factors and understand the importance of each feature, using Python. I tested my experiments with different statistical methods such as ANOVA analysis or calculating moving standard deviations. I was also responsible for the data visualization and presenting them to an audience with diverse backgrounds.
